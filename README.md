# React Router's RSC Demo

⚠️ **EXPERIMENTAL**: This demo showcases React Router's unique approach to React
Server Components (RSC). This is experimental technology and not recommended for
production use.

This project demonstrates React Router's innovative RSC integration featuring:

- **RSC from Loaders**: Return React elements directly from loaders/actions for
  incremental adoption
- **Server Component Routes**: Mixed server/client routes in the same app tree
- **Zero Bundle Routes**: Server-only routes that never send JavaScript to the
  browser
- **Automatic Revalidation**: Server actions with seamless cache management

Built with Vite and powered by React Router's experimental RSC implementation.
